## Code of Conduct

This project follows a code of conduct to ensure a welcoming environment:

- **Be respectful:** Treat all contributors with respect and professionalism
- **Be collaborative:** Work together to improve patient safety and care quality
- **Be patient-focused:** All contributions should prioritize patient safety
- **Follow regulations:** Ensure all contributions comply with medical device regulations
- **Protect PHI:** Never include patient data in contributions

## How to Contribute

### üêõ Reporting Bugs

1. **Check existing issues** first to avoid duplicates
2. **Use the bug report template** when creating new issues
3. **Include system information:**
   - Eclipse version
   - ESAPI version
   - .NET Framework version
   - Operating system
4. **Provide reproduction steps** with sample (anonymized) data if possible
5. **Include error messages** and log files

### üí° Suggesting Features

1. **Check the roadmap** to see if it's already planned
2. **Open a feature request** with detailed description
3. **Explain the clinical benefit** and use cases
4. **Consider implementation complexity** and maintenance impact

### üîß Code Contributions

1. **Fork the repository**
2. **Create a feature branch** (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. **Make your changes** following our coding standards
4. **Test thoroughly** with Eclipse
5. **Commit your changes** (`git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`)
6. **Push to the branch** (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
7. **Open a Pull Request**

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Visual Studio 2019+** or VS Code with C# extension
- **Eclipse Treatment Planning System** (13.6+)
- **ESAPI SDK** (contact Varian for access)
- **.NET Framework 4.5+**
- **Git** for version control

### Local Development

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/eclipse-plan-check.git
cd eclipse-plan-check

# Create development branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Set up Eclipse script testing environment
# Copy script to Eclipse scripts directory for testing
cp "PlanCheck Template Simple.cs" "\\eclipsefsprd\va_data$\ProgramData\Vision\PublishedScripts\"
```

### Testing Environment

- **Use test patients only** - never use real patient data
- **Test with various plan types:** IMRT, VMAT, 3D-CRT, SRS, SBRT
- **Verify different anatomical sites:** brain, H&N, thorax, abdomen, pelvis
- **Test edge cases:** plans without dose, missing structures, unusual beam arrangements

## Submission Guidelines

### Pull Request Process

1. **Update documentation** for any user-facing changes
2. **Add tests** for new functionality
3. **Ensure compatibility** with supported Eclipse/ESAPI versions
4. **Update CHANGELOG.md** with your changes
5. **Request review** from project maintainers

### Pull Request Checklist

- [ ] Code follows project style guidelines
- [ ] Self-review completed
- [ ] Changes tested in Eclipse environment
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md updated
- [ ] No patient data included
- [ ] Backwards compatibility maintained

## Coding Standards

### C# Style Guidelines

```csharp
// Use descriptive variable names
var treatmentBeams = plan.Beams.Where(b => !b.IsSetupField).ToList();

// Include comprehensive error handling
try
{
    var dosePerFraction = plan.DosePerFraction.Dose;
    sb.AppendLine("‚úì Dose per fraction: " + dosePerFraction.ToString("F1") + " cGy");
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    sb.AppendLine("‚ùå Error retrieving dose information: " + ex.Message);
}

// Use clear comments for complex logic
// Check for reasonable MU values to identify potential calculation errors
foreach (var beam in treatmentBeams)
{
    if (beam.Meterset.Value > 1000)
    {
        sb.AppendLine("‚ö† WARNING: High MU value for beam " + beam.Id);
    }
}
```

### Documentation Standards

- **XML comments** for all public methods
- **Inline comments** for complex algorithms
- **Clear variable names** that explain purpose
- **Error messages** that help users understand issues

### ESAPI Best Practices

- **Always check for null** before accessing ESAPI objects
- **Use try-catch blocks** for property access that might fail
- **Handle version differences** gracefully
- **Dispose resources** properly when applicable

## Testing

### Required Tests

1. **Basic functionality:** Script runs without errors
2. **Multiple plan types:** IMRT, VMAT, 3D-CRT, electrons
3. **Edge cases:** Empty structures, missing dose, unusual beam arrangements
4. **Error handling:** Invalid plans, missing data
5. **UI responsiveness:** Window behavior, button functionality

### Test Data Requirements

- **Use only test patients** with anonymized data
- **Cover various anatomical sites**
- **Include both simple and complex plans**
- **Test approved and unapproved plans**
- **Include plans with common issues**

### Testing Checklist

- [ ] Script compiles without warnings
- [ ] All tabs display correctly
- [ ] Visual indicators work properly (‚úÖ ‚ö†Ô∏è ‚ùå)
- [ ] Eclipse remains functional during script execution
- [ ] Error handling works for edge cases
- [ ] Performance is acceptable for large plans

## Documentation

### Documentation Types

1. **Code documentation:** XML comments and inline comments
2. **User documentation:** README.md updates
3. **API documentation:** Method and property descriptions
4. **Clinical documentation:** Safety considerations and workflows

### Documentation Requirements

- **Update README.md** for user-facing changes
- **Add examples** for new features
- **Include screenshots** for UI changes
- **Document breaking changes** clearly
- **Maintain clinical accuracy**
