# Eclipse Plan Check Script

A comprehensive plan verification tool for Varian Eclipse Treatment Planning System using ESAPI.

## Overview

This script provides automated plan checking functionality to help medical physicists and dosimetrists verify treatment plans before delivery. It performs comprehensive analysis across multiple categories and presents results in an easy-to-read tabbed interface.

## Features

### üìã Plan Information
- Patient demographics and plan details
- Course and structure set information
- Image resolution and metadata
- Plan creation and approval tracking

### üíä Dose Information
- Prescription details (dose per fraction, total dose)
- Dose calculation status and grid information
- Algorithm verification (photon/electron models)
- Plan normalization settings

### ‚ö° Beam Information
- Complete beam inventory (treatment vs setup)
- Detailed beam parameters (energy, angles, MU, field sizes)
- Safety checks for unusual monitor unit values
- Total treatment time calculations

### üéØ Structure Information
- Automatic categorization (targets, OARs, body, supports)
- Volume calculations and verification
- Missing structure identification
- Empty structure warnings

### ‚úÖ Status & Safety Checks
- Treatment approval status
- Critical safety verification
- Treatment readiness assessment
- Comprehensive error reporting

## Installation

1. **Download the script:**
   - Download `PlanCheck Template Simple.cs` from this repository

2. **Deploy to Eclipse:**
   - Copy the script to your Eclipse scripts directory:
     ```
     \\eclipsefsprd\va_data$\ProgramData\Vision\PublishedScripts\
     ```

3. **Run from Eclipse:**
   - Open a patient and plan in Eclipse
   - Navigate to Tools ‚Üí Scripts
   - Select and run "PlanCheck Template Simple"

## Usage

1. **Load a patient and plan** in Eclipse
2. **Run the script** from the Tools ‚Üí Scripts menu
3. **Review results** in the tabbed interface:
   - Plan Info: Basic plan and patient information
   - Dose: Prescription and calculation details
   - Beams: Treatment beam analysis
   - Structures: Target and OAR verification
   - Status: Safety checks and treatment readiness
4. **Make corrections** in Eclipse as needed
5. **Rerun the script** to verify fixes

## System Requirements

- **Eclipse Version:** 13.6 or later
- **ESAPI Version:** 1.0.300.11 or compatible
- **.NET Framework:** 4.5 or later
- **Permissions:** Read access to Eclipse patient database

## Key Benefits

### üîç Comprehensive Analysis
- Covers all critical plan verification areas
- Automated safety checks reduce human error
- Consistent verification workflow

### üöÄ Improved Workflow
- Non-blocking design keeps Eclipse functional
- Clear visual indicators (‚úÖ ‚ö†Ô∏è ‚ùå)
- Instant plan overview across multiple tabs

### üìà Quality Assurance
- Standardized checking procedures
- Detailed error reporting
- Treatment readiness verification

## Visual Indicators

- ‚úÖ **Green checkmark:** Verified/acceptable values
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Yellow warning:** Attention needed but not blocking
- ‚ùå **Red error:** Critical issue requiring correction

## Troubleshooting

### Script Won't Run
- Ensure patient and plan are loaded in Eclipse
- Verify script is in the correct Eclipse scripts directory
- Check that plan has required components (structure set, dose calculation)

### "Refresh" Errors
- The refresh button is disabled by design
- To get updated results after making changes, close the window and rerun the script
- This ensures fresh data from Eclipse

### Missing Information
- Some fields may not be available in older ESAPI versions
- The script gracefully handles missing properties
- Contact your system administrator for ESAPI version information
